# RAT.unknown.exe Malware Analysis

## Objective  
The goal of this project was to analyze a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) sample (`RAT.unknown.exe`) in a controlled home lab environment using FLARE VM and REMnux. The objective was to investigate how the malware behaves, communicates, establishes persistence, and allows remote access.

### Skills Learned
- Performing static analysis using FLOSS and VirusTotal
- Setting up INetSim and Wireshark for C2 traffic emulation
- Detecting host-based indicators with Procmon and TCPView
- Capturing and decoding base64-encoded command & control messages
- Identifying persistence mechanisms via file path monitoring
- Establishing remote shell access via Ncat

### Tools Used
- FLARE VM (Windows Analysis)
- REMnux (Network Emulation & Packet Capture)
- VirusTotal
- FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver)
- INetSim (Fake Internet Services)
- Wireshark (Packet Analysis)
- Procmon (Process Monitor)
- TCPView
- Ncat

## Steps

### 1. Static Analysis
- Uploaded the malware hash to VirusTotal and confirmed detection by multiple engines.  
- Used **FLOSS** to extract strings; discovered:
  - Suspicious domains like `http://serv1.ec2-102-95-13-2-ubuntu.local`
  - Payload links such as `https://msdcorelib.exe`
  - File names and indicators of persistence behavior

### 2. Dynamic Analysis (FLARE VM + REMnux)
- Ran the malware on FLARE VM and got a pop-up:  
  **"No Soup Found"**

- Suspecting C2 interaction, I:
  - Set REMnuxâ€™s DNS as the host machine DNS
  - Ran **INetSim** to emulate fake internet services
  - Started Wireshark to capture traffic

- On re-running the malware:
  - It attempted to reach `http://serv1.ec2-102-95-13-2-ubuntu.local`
  - The pop-up no longer appeared
  - It downloaded a secondary file from `https://msdcorelib.exe`

### 3. Host-Based Behavioral Analysis
- Launched **Procmon** and filtered events by the malware's process name
  - Found the malware dropped a file to the `C:\Users\Public\Startup\` folder
  - Classic Windows persistence tactic

- Used **TCPView** to inspect network activity
  - Found the malware listening on **port 5555**

### 4. Post-Exploitation
- Connected to the open socket using:  
  `ncat -nv 10.0.0.4 5555`

- Sent encoded system commands like `ipconfig` and received Base64-encoded results
- Decoded response showed system IP configuration
- Got a **Base64-encoded response**:

## Summary  
This project provided hands-on experience in dissecting a real-world RAT, understanding how it hides, communicates with C2 servers, achieves persistence, and enables remote access. It also strengthened my analysis workflow using both host-based and network-based tools in a home lab setup.

## Next Steps (Future Improvements)
- Reverse engineering the downloaded payload with Ghidra or IDA
- Automating detection rules using Sigma/YARA
- Writing custom Suricata rules based on C2 traffic

## Disclaimer
This analysis was conducted in a secure, isolated lab environment. The sample and tools used are for educational and research purposes only.
